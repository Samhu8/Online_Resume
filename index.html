    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am an experienced call center agent and supervisor who has found a desire to move into the world of software development.
    The best part of my job in call center roles was when I got to use data and create something that everyone can use
    in the form of reports or visual representations on where we are as a department. I discovered coding and have loved it ever
    since I started and hope to make it a full time career.
